# This Hermes2D module solves a general 
# second-order linear equation of the form
# -div(c1 \nabla u) + (c2, c3) \cdot \nabla u + c4 u = c5
# where c1, c2, ..., c5 are piecewise constant 
# functions. It is necessary that c1 > 0 
# everywhere in the domain. Dirichlet, 
# Neumann, and Newton boundary conditions
# can be used. See the file basic.h for details.
